econ-take-home
==============

My gauss code for the second take home exam in advanced econometrics. Please dont copy blindly or do something similarly stupid. We are supposed to hand in an inidividual solution each. Please compare your solution with mine and do let me know if I made a mistake ;-)

Also note that this is WIP and might not be ready when you are comparing.
